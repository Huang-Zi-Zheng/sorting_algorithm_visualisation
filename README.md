# sorting_algorithm_visualisation
I build a Sorting Algorithm Visualisation using Python on Pycharm CE.

The sorting algorithm I chose is selection sorting, where the algorithm will find the smallest rectangle over the range of data and put it at the next sorted list. 

Credit to Robot Maze for sharing a tutorial video on how to create this model. 

Had so much fun doing this project!
